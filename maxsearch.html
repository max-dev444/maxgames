// --------------------------
// 6. ADDING DATA INSTRUCTIONS
// --------------------------
// 1. Find the "data" object near the top of the script.
// 2. Each entry is: "keyword": "Definition here",
// 3. Add a comma after each entry except the last one.
// 4. Keywords are not case-sensitive because the search converts everything to lowercase.
// 5. You can add thousands of entries here; performance is fine for 8000+.
