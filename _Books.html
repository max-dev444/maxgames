`<h1>Book I — The Last Purchase</h1>
<h2>Chapter One</h2>
<p>Noah didn’t mean to spend it. He wasn’t trying to be bad. He wasn’t trying to steal. He was just tired — tired of being the kid nobody noticed, tired of being the gray avatar in a glowing world.</p>
<p>At school, people passed him like he wasn’t there. At home, his mom was always working, always worrying. Roblox was the only place where Noah felt like he could be someone else.</p>
<p>That night, his mom fell asleep on the couch, her phone glowing softly. A bank app was still open. Noah didn’t look at the number. He didn’t want to.</p>
<p>Back in his room, Roblox lit up the screen with colors brighter than real life. A banner appeared: <em>LIMITED — STARFALL ANGEL WINGS</em>.</p>
<p>They were beautiful. They looked like something someone important would wear.</p>
<p>Noah clicked Buy.</p>
<p>Then again.</p>
<p>And again.</p>
<p>With every purchase, his avatar became more powerful — and his chest felt heavier.</p>
<p>Then he heard something from the kitchen.</p>
<p>His mom was crying.</p>
<p>“That money was for rent,” she said quietly.</p>
<p>Noah returned to his room and removed every item from his avatar — the wings, the crown, the light. Until all that was left was a small, plain character standing alone.</p>
<p>The Robux didn’t come back.</p>
<p>And neither did the peace.</p>`,

`<h1>Book II — The Light After the Last Purchase</h1>
<h2>Chapter One</h2>
<p>Noah didn’t log into Roblox for days. Instead he watched his mom do math on scraps of paper, erasing hope over and over.</p>
<p>He had one dollar.</p>
<p>Outside, the real world felt strange — quiet and huge. In a store window, a sign read: <strong>LOTTERY — DREAM BIG</strong>.</p>
<p>He bought a ticket.</p>
<p>When the numbers matched, his hands shook.</p>
<p>$100,000.</p>
<p>His mom cried, not from sadness, but from relief.</p>
<p>Noah gave her 80%. For rent. For food. For peace.</p>
<p>The rest he used for Robux — but this time, without guilt.</p>
<p>When he returned to Roblox, his avatar glowed again — but now Noah knew he didn’t need it to matter.</p>
<p>This time, the light was real.</p>`
