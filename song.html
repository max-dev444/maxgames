(1 minute of loud, catchy guitar solo)
[Chorus]
Say no more!
We did what you want,
just no more!
We did all you want,
so say no more!
say no more, today!
[Verse 1]
sing along, to this rhythm, baby!
sing along, to it all, and go and,
see the ways, of nature!

I found my ways,
I find my pride,
deep inside, 
the end, of my mind.
I say a prayer,
deep in their,
where nobody can watch and stare,
all of them, should have the day to have,
everything, they want!
[Chorus]
say no more!
we did what you want,
just no more!
We did all you want,
so say no more!
say, no more!

say no more!
we did what you want,
just no more!
We did all the work,
just no more!
say,
no more!

[Bridge]
1 foot high,
2 foot branch,
everyone's looking in the place for more,
everyone's looking for more, of that cash!
that cold hard cash,
oh, that cold hard cash,
oh, its everything, to some,
its everything, for most of us,
[Chorus]
So,
say no more!
we did what you want,
just no more!
We did all you want,
so say no more!
say no more, today!

say no more!
we did what you want,
just no more!
We did all the work,
just no more!
say,
say,
say,
no, more!
